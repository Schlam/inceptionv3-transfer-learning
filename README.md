# Image recognition with transfer learning


Computer vision has improved rapidly over the past decade due to a few intersecting trends:

 - Research advancements in machine learning
 - Petabytes of image data available online
 - Open Source culture with in AI community


One tool in a data scientists toolbox is **transfer learning**. This is particularly useful for image recognition, which typically requires a large amount of training data and extensive computation.


Instead of training a model from scratch, we can import the weights from another model a basis for our specific use case.
